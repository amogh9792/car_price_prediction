**Car Price Prediction Project**

This project focuses on predicting the prices of cars using machine learning techniques. The project follows a structured workflow encompassing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and deployment.

**Project Overview:**

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of features, identify patterns, and detect outliers. Visualizations and statistical analysis aid in gaining insights into the relationship between car features and prices.

2. **Data Preprocessing:** Data preprocessing tasks include handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling, and handling outliers. The dataset is transformed to ensure compatibility and consistency for model training.

3. **Model Building:** Machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting are trained on the preprocessed dataset to predict car prices. Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques are employed to optimize model performance.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained models are evaluated using performance metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and R-squared to assess their accuracy in predicting car prices.

5. **Model Deployment:** The selected model is deployed, allowing users to input car features and receive price predictions.
